# A Formalization of ∞-Categories in Lean 4

A formal verification project based on the work by Enric Cosme Llópez on
_Higher-order categories_.

## Overview

In many works on Category Theory, in addition to the usual many-sorted notions
of n-categories and of ∞-categories, the single-sorted versions of them are
also commonly used.

The aim of this project is to provide a formalization of the latter notions and
the proof of their equivalence in Lean 4.

> [!INFO]
> For the moment, this is an active research project for a Mathematics degree
> final project. The project is in early stages.

## Development

Work in progress.
